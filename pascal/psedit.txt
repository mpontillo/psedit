PSEDIT is guaranteed to do NOTHING.  Due to the nature of PS savegames, there
is often very little we CAN do.  So I STRONGLY advise you to back up your
savegames before using this editor.

WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST, OR IN ANY WAY CORRUPTED FILES!  I have tried
to make this product as bug free as possible but there could be some unforseen
errors.

If you find any bugs in PSEDIT, or have any suggestions of any kind, please
drop me an e-mail at <mike_pontillo@royal.net>.  I would be happy to hear
your feedback.

                             EDITING INFO/TIPS
                             ~-תתתתתתתתתתתתת-~

 * Phantasy Star re-calculates attack and defense strength, along with
   maximum HP and MP points whenever you go into battle.  These values
   have been found, as far as I can tell, to be calculated from some kind of
   a lookup table, (an array, actually) based on the player's level.  So,
   if you set the level to 30 (the maximum) and fight something, a lot of
   the stats will take care of themselves.  Keep this in mind when you're
   editing your savegames -- PS will only let your character become so
   powerful.  If you set your level higher than 30 (for all you programming
   types out there) it appears that it causes PS to look up a level that
   doesn't exist, which could either be another character's stats, or junk.
   (in other words, BE CAREFUL!)

 * A neat thing you can do is equip other characters weapons, or weapons that
   aren't actually weapons.  (For example, I equipped some armor as my weapon
   once, and my attack was the "fire" spell.)  But be warned -- this has been
   known to crash the SMS emmulator when that character tries to attack.

 * Don't give a character more spells than they actually have.  This will
   cause PS to crash if you try to cast that spell.  See the chart below:

               +-------------------+------+------+------+------+
               |                   | Alis | Myau | Odin | Noah |
               +-------------------+------+------+------+------+
               |     combat spells |   5  |   4  |   0  |   5  |
               +-------------------+------+------+------+------+
               | non-combat spells |   2  |   3  |   0  |   5  |
               +-------------------+------+------+------+------+

   However, what you set that to probably won't matter too much anyway, since
   the spells are looked back up based on the level when a battle occurs. 
 
 * Don't give yourself more than 24 or so items, as Phantasy Star will start
   doing VERY STRANGE things.  If you want to do some testing and research
   on how PS reacts, fine.  Do so, and get back to me about it.  I've been
   trying to figure out how the "numitems" variable relates to the item list,
   but it appears to be a bit inconsistant.  (numitems is the number of items
   currently in your inventory, as reported by PSEDIT on the status line in
   the item editor)

If you find a bug in this editor (and you probably will, if you use it enough)
please drop me an email at <mike_pontillo@royal.net> and I will take care of
it/get back to you as soon as time permits.  However, PSEDIT has become
more trouble than it's worth at 1000+ lines of code, plus library files that
I have written.

PSEDIT was written in a mixture Turbo Pascal 7 and assembly language.
